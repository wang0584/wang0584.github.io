        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone, My name is  Wang Xuefeng. Different from most of my classmates, I have more than ten years of work experience.  I completed my undergraduate studies in Economic Law and obtained the <abbr title="Master of Business Administration">MBA</abbr> degree in China. Before immigrating to Canada, I worked in a construction company in China, my positions ranged from assistant director to project manager to vice executive director. After coming to Canada at Sep25<sup>th</sup> 2015, I worked in sales and customer service in the company Arterra Wine and Rideau Carlton Raceway. I love trying new jobs and constantly challenging myself. Through different jobs, I can learn new knowledge and feel the difference of the world through different life experiences.</p>
        <h2>What do I focus on</h2>
        <p>More and more I realize the importance of teamwork. In the field of computer network technology, tasks are completed by one or more teams. Adequate communication can reduce misunderstandings and make mission objectives clear and consistent. In a good team, there must be both obedience and leadership judgment, and there must be a compromise as well as persistence and debate. obviously, each team member has good professional skills is the most basic.</p>
        <h2>Motivational Quote I Love</h2>
        <q><em>Courage</em> is like <strong>love</strong>; it must have <strong>hope</strong> for nourishment--Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821)</q>
